Little Codey is an interplanetary space boxer who is trying to win championship belts for various weight categories on other planets within the solar system.

Write a space.py program that helps Codey keep track of their target weight by:

Checking which number planet is equal to.
1. Computing Codeyâ€™s weight on the destination planet.
2. Here is the table of conversions:

#	Planet	Relative Gravity
1	Venus	0.91
2	Mars	0.38
3	Jupiter	2.34
4	Saturn	1.06
5	Uranus	0.92
6	Neptune	1.19
