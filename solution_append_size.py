"""
Create a function called append_size that has one parameter named my_list.
The function should append the size of my_list (inclusive) to the end of my_list.
The function should then return this new list.
For example, if my_list was [23, 42, 108], the function should return [23, 42, 108, 3] because the size of my_list was originally 3.

# Uncomment the line below when your function is done
