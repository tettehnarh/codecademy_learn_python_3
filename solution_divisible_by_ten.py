"""
Create a function called divisible_by_ten() that has one parameter named num.
The function should return True if num is divisible by 10, and False otherwise.
Consider using modulo operator % to check for divisibility.

# Write your divisible_by_ten() function here:


def divisible_by_ten(num):
    if num % 10 == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False


# Uncomment these print() function calls to test your divisible_by_ten() function:

print(divisible_by_ten(20))
# should print True
print(divisible_by_ten(25))
# should print False
