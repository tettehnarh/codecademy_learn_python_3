"""
Some say that every one year of a human’s life is equivalent to seven years of a dog’s life.
Write a function named dog_years() that has two parameters named name and age.
The function should compute the age in dog years and return the following string:
"{name}, you are {age} years old in dog years"
Test this function with your name and your age!
"""
# Write your dog_years function here:


def dog_years(name, age):

    if age > 0:
        age *= 7
    else:
        age = 0

    new_string = name + ", you are " + str(age) + " years old in dog years"

    return new_string


# Uncomment these function calls to test your dog_years function:
print(dog_years("Lola", 16))
# should print "Lola, you are 112 years old in dog years"
print(dog_years("Baby", 0))
# should print "Baby, you are 0 years old in dog years"
