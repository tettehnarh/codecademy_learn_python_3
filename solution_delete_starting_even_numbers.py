"""
Write a function called delete_starting_evens() that has a parameter named my_list.
The function should remove elements from the front of my_list until the front of the list is not even.
The function should then return my_list.
For example if my_list started as [4, 8, 10, 11, 12, 15], then delete_starting_evens(my_list) should return [11, 12, 15].
Make sure your function works even if every element in the list is even!
