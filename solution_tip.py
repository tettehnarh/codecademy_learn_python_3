"""
Create a function called tip() that has two parameters named total and percentage.
This function should return the amount you should tip given a total and the percentage you want to tip.
"""
# Write your tip function here:


def tip(total, percentage):
    return (total*percentage) / 100


# Uncomment these function calls to test your tip function:
print(tip(10, 25))
# should print 2.5
print(tip(0, 100))
# should print 0.0
