"""
Create a function named exponents() that takes two lists as parameters named bases and powers.
Return a new list containing every number in bases raised to every number in powers.
For example, consider the following code.
exponents([2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3])
the result would be the list [2, 4, 8, 3, 9, 27, 4, 16, 64]. It would first add two to the first.
Then two to the second. Then two to the third, and so on.
