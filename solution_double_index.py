"""
Create a function named double_index that has two parameters: a list named my_list and a single number named index.
The function should return a new list where all elements are the same as in my_list except for the element at index.
The element at index should be double the value of the element at index of the original my_list.
If index is not a valid index, the function should return the original list.
For example, the following code should return [1,2,6,4] because the element at index 2 has been doubled:
double_index([1, 2, 3, 4], 2)
After writing your function, un-comment the call to the function that weâ€™ve provided for you to test your results.
